# Week 2

Code and example code for Week 2 tasks for SIT722: Software Deployment and Operations.

In Week 2, you will containerized your first microservices using `Python` and `Docker`.

Before we start containerizing microservices, we need to install `Docker`. Download the [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Refer to `README.md` in each sub-directory for more information.
